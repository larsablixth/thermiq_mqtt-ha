"""Tests for the widget's flow animations, which nothing else can check.

Every flow in the drawing is two elements that have to agree: a dashed path
whose ``stroke-dashoffset`` animates, and one or more chevron arrowheads driven
along the same path by ``offset-path``. Nothing in the markup relates them, so
they agree only because two numbers were written the same way twice.

They diverge silently. Both halves animate, so the drawing still moves and a
screenshot still looks right - the head simply travels at a different speed to
the dashes it sits in, which is only obvious once someone watches it for a few
seconds on a live install. That is how it was found (#82), and only at low pump
speed: the two expressions agree at --vpw:100 and diverge as the multiplier
falls, so the bug hides at exactly the speed a demo or a busy pump runs at.
