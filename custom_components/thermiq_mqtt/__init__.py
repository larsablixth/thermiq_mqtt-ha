#
#   "extra_js"  - add_extra_js_url. The module is imported from the frontend
#                 index at page bootstrap. What we have always shipped.
#   "resource"  - registered in Lovelace's own resource list, the documented
#                 route every HACS card uses.
#
# Never both: each mechanism imports the module under its own URL, and a
# second evaluation of the module calls customElements.define with a name that
# already exists, which throws.
#
# "resource" is the default because "extra_js" is measurably broken, for a
# reason that took a browser to find (#28).
#
# add_extra_js_url imports the card from the frontend index, at page
# bootstrap - earlier than any other custom card, which all arrive later as
# Lovelace resources. Something in a loaded page then patches
# customElements.define in place: it is native at document-start and a
# polyfill implementation by the time the dashboard renders, with its own
# internal registry. A define() that ran before that patch lands in the
# native registry and is invisible to the patched one Home Assistant then
# queries - so the element exists, window.customCards lists it, the card's
# own banner is in the console, and Lovelace still reports "Custom element
# doesn't exist", permanently, for that page load.
#
# Measured on a live installation, same browser, same steps:
#
#   extra_js   first load: undefined, 0 widgets | after Ctrl+F5: undefined, 0
#   resource   first load: function,  1 widget  | after Ctrl+F5: function,  1
#
# Being a resource puts us in the same load phase as every other custom card,
# after the patch. That is why every HACS card works and only ours did not.
